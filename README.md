# Texas Air Permits: Extracting Maximum Allowable Emissions Rate Tables

This repository aims to extract maximum allowable emissions rate tables (MAERTs) from all publicly-available "air new source permits" published by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). The data was last refreshed on April 5, 2024.

For general documentation, read this [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dJIYn_4FDi1xqVX2ouW0tIdX0m9RxJCeMvTg_j1kJ8w/edit?usp=sharing). For technical documentation, read below.

## Overview

### What are Maximum Allowable Emissions Rate Tables (MAERTS)?

Maximum Allowable Emissions Rate Tables (MAERTs) are a key component of air permits issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). Any business or entity involved in activities—such as manufacturing, fuel combustion, construction, or other operations—that may impact air quality must obtain an air permit from the TCEQ.

Per air permit application, the TCEQ evaluates potential emissions and sets maximum allowable emissions for pollutants. The result is a MAERT. The limits in these tables ensure compliance with air quality standards under the Texas Clean Air Act and federal regulations. Non-compliance with the maximum allowable emissions set by the TCEQ can result in fines, penalties, or shutdowns.

### What is the process behind extracting MAERTs from Texas air permits?

The TCEQ stores air permit PDFs in an online database that requires specific filters to retrieve results. It’s useful for finding individual documents by address, Regulated Entity Name (organization or individual filing for permits), or RN (an 11-digit unique ID for facility locations). However, it is not ideal for mass downloading of files by category. 

Our process is as follows:

1. Compile a list of Regulated Entity Names and RNs by searching [TCEQ’s Regulated Entity Search](https://www15.tceq.texas.gov/crpub/index.cfm?fuseaction=regent.RNSearch) database, using all of Texas’ counties and zip codes as search criteria. 
2. For each RN, scrape the TCEQ’s document portal for “new source review permit” PDFs.
3. Extract the MAERT from the PDFs as standardized, structured data.

### What data are you providing?

We have provided three resources: 

- data/combined_entities.csv
    - This is a list of all Regulated Entity Names, RNs, and other metadata as of the last scrape date, created from the first step of the process.
- data/MAERT_lookup.csv
    - This file is a lookup table for all scraped MAERTs in data/MAERT. Note: A Regulated Entity may have multiple MAERTs (e.g., a business or individual may apply for air permits multiple times), and a RN may have multiple MAERTs (e.g., a site could have several associated air permits).
- data/final.csv.zip
    - This file is the output of the MAERT extraction process, compressed due to Github’s [large file storage limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github). It contains all MAERTs for the scraped RNs, standardized into a single, large table.
 
### What potential uses are there for this data? 
These datasets can help answer important questions about air pollution, regulation, and environmental impacts in Texas. These are a few ideas for how it might be used. If you end up working with this data, the Data Liberation Project would love to hear from you!

**Environmental Justice & Public Health**: Who is most exposed to pollution — and where?
- Map permitted emission limits alongside demographic data (like race, income, or health outcomes).
- Identify neighborhoods with especially high concentrations of permitted pollution.

**Corporate Accountability**: Who’s polluting the most and how has that changed over time?
- Rank companies or industries by total permitted emissions.
- Track changes over time for specific companies or facilities.
- Link facilities with high MAERTs to environmental violations, fines, or lawsuits.

## Caveats and Limitations

MAERTs across air permit PDFs lack consistent, clean formatting. Air permit MAERTs are split between three categories: easy tables, tricky tables, and unknown tables, and the scripts use different methods to parse each.

Friendlier PDF formats with improved MAERTs (easy tables) appeared in 1992 and gained wider adoption in the early 2010s, but still do not comprise all MAERTs.

 Despite this, extraction strategies were generally successful across reports.
